ANSWER TO ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================

Q: "Where do we stand with slot machine, model menus, performance queue?"

A: SHORT VERSION
   • Slot Machine: ✅ Backend 100% complete, ⏸️ Blocked on queue integration
   • Model Menus: ⚠️ Core exists (40%), needs 3-4 days of work
   • Performance Queue: 📋 Design complete, 🔴 Implementation NOT started

A: PRODUCTION STATUS
   • None of the three features are production-ready
   • Performance Queue MUST be built first (2 weeks)
   • Then slot machine integration (1 week)
   • Then model menus enhancement (1 week)
   • Total timeline: 5-8 weeks to production

A: BLOCKING ISSUE
   • Performance Queue is the critical dependency
   • Required by Integration Contract v1
   • All interactive features must route through it
   • Implementation must start immediately

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

SLOT MACHINE
✅ Complete:
   - Backend API fully implemented
   - Security compliant (0 CodeQL alerts)
   - Rate limiting, CSPRNG, idempotency
   - Complete audit trail
   - Documentation comprehensive

⏸️ Blocked:
   - Performance Queue integration (architectural requirement)
   - RedRoomRewards API integration
   - Age/jurisdiction compliance checks

📅 Timeline: 3-4 weeks after Performance Queue is ready

MODEL MENUS
✅ Complete:
   - Core CRUD service exists
   - Hierarchical menu support
   - Database schema in place

⚠️ Needs Work:
   - Performer association (missing)
   - Interactive feature integration
   - Purchase flow implementation
   - Performance Queue integration

📅 Timeline: 1-2 weeks after Performance Queue is ready

PERFORMANCE QUEUE
✅ Complete:
   - Architectural design 100%
   - Integration contract defined
   - 7 implementation phases outlined
   - Security requirements documented

🔴 Critical Gap:
   - ZERO implementation started
   - This blocks ALL other features
   - Must start immediately

📅 Timeline: 2 weeks for full implementation

================================================================================
CRITICAL PATH TO PRODUCTION
================================================================================

Week 1-2: Performance Queue Implementation
         ├─ Phase 1: Core module setup (3-4 days)
         ├─ Phase 2: Escrow & wallet integration (2-3 days)
         └─ Phase 3: Queue lifecycle management (2-3 days)

Week 3:   Slot Machine Integration
         ├─ Refactor to use queue (2 days)
         ├─ Integration tests (2 days)
         └─ RedRoomRewards API integration (1 day)

Week 4:   Model Menus Enhancement
         ├─ Performer association (1-2 days)
         ├─ Interactive feature integration (2 days)
         └─ Testing (1 day)

Week 5-6: Frontend Development & Testing
         ├─ UI components (3-4 days)
         ├─ Integration testing (2 days)
         └─ Load testing (2 days)

Week 7-8: Final Polish & Production Prep
         ├─ Compliance review (2 days)
         ├─ Documentation finalization (1 day)
         └─ Deployment preparation (2 days)

BEST CASE:    5-6 weeks (with 3 dedicated engineers)
REALISTIC:    6-8 weeks (with 2-3 engineers)
PESSIMISTIC:  8-10 weeks (with blockers/scope changes)

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
================================================================================
